/* 
2 Cases: 
Case 1:
In cases you have 2 components B, and C (siblings and children) getting leveraged within component A (parent), and you require component B, C to follow the same wrapper CSS flow, use this style on B or C
Case 2:
Case also when you have component B (nested) in component A (parent) and A adds more tags to B, then apply this styles to B - Note: you can also just style A's wrapper
